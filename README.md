# Log Aggregator & Real-Time Monitoring System

A **high-performance, Rust-based log aggregation and monitoring system** with real-time dashboard, metrics collection, and asynchronous persistence. Designed to handle logs from multiple microservices efficiently and provide actionable insights instantly.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Concurrent In-Memory Log Storage:** Handles **50,000+ log entries** efficiently using `Arc<Mutex<Vec<LogEntry>>>`.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Live dashboard updates via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.
- **Filterable Logs:** Filter logs by **service** and **level** (INFO, WARN, ERROR).
- **Prometheus Integration:** Tracks **total logs received** and exposes metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) for monitoring system health.
- **Persistent Storage:** Asynchronous saving of logs to disk to ensure durability.
- **Simulated Log Generator:** Generates semi-realistic logs with rare critical events for testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/SuvitKumar003/Log_aggregator_Rust>
cd Log_aggregator_Rust
2. Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup update

Install dependencies

cargo build


Configure the server

Modify config.toml to set server host, port, logging file path, max logs in memory, and persistence interval.

Run the server

cargo run


Run the log generator (optional)

cargo run --bin log_generator
